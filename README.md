<h1>Hi 👋, I'm Sebastian</h1>
<h3>Self taught software engineer and statistics fanatic.</h3>

I’m a software engineer based in Poland  🇵🇱. I write about my problems through the difficulties encountered along the software development path on [my blog](https://zboru.github.io/). I mainly write about programming and learning, there will also be all kinds of tips and interesting facts. In my free time, I like to play games or watch some TV series.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as Fullstack developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript/PHP using Vue and Laravel
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects using _(mainly)_ those two languages
- 💬 Ask me about PHP/JS or anything else. Who knows, maybe I know the answer...
