<h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sebastian</h1>
<h3>Self taught software engineer and statistics lover.</h3>

Iâ€™m a software engineer based in Poland  ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±. I plan to create a blog where I'll write about my problems through the difficulties encountered along the software development path on [my blog](https://zboru.github.io/blog). I mainly write about programming and learning, there will also be all kinds of tips and interesting facts. In my free time, I like to play games or watch some TV series or .

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as Fullstack developer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript/PHP using Vue and Laravel
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects using _(mainly)_ those two languages
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about PHP/JS or anything else. Who knows, maybe I know the answer...
